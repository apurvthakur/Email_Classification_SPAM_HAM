# Email_Classification_SPAM_HAM

This Python code lets you classify whether the email is a SPAM or not.
Instead of using any one classification technique, the program contains multiple classification models.

In order to run the program make sure that the emails.csv file is in the same folder in which your python program exists.
The final output is the accuracy of various models along with the corresponding Confusion Matrix.

The dataset is downlaoded from https://www.kaggle.com/karthickveerakumar/spam-filter/downloads/emails.csv/1
